# ChessWebApp

This is a web application for setting up and playing a chess game with a friend. In the future, I'll add more features, like adding stuff to the game UI, adding the ability to play against the computer and being able to load a scenario from a PGN file. I started this to get more experience working with Python and have an even better understanding of web applications.
